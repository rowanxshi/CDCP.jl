	policy(C::Integer; scdca::Bool, obj, equalise_obj, [D_j_obj, zero_D_j_obj])

Find the policy function for a combinatorial discrete choice problem over `C` choices and one dimension of heterogeneity with SCD-C from above if `scdca` is `true` (otherwise, from below) and SCD-T. The solver uses the objective function `obj(J, z)`, which must accept as argument a Boolean vector with length `C` and the heterogeneous component `z` and the `equalise_obj((J1, J2), l, r)` function, which identifies the `z` where the agent is indifferent between the pair `(J1, J2)`. The routine provides the interval `[l, r]` along which this search is performed; if the marginal type is not in the interval, it is sufficient to return `nothing`.

The solver can optionally take `D_j_obj(j, J, z)` and `zero_D_j_obj(j, J, l, r)`, user-supplied functions. The first is the marginal value function, while the second identifies the `z` where the marginal value of item `j` to set `J` is zero. For the second, the solver provides the interval `[l, r]` within which this marginal type is located. It is sufficient to return `nothing` is the marginal type is not within the interval. If not provided, the solver automatically constructs these using the `equalise_obj` function.
